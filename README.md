# Information Security RSA Algorithm
Modification and Implementation of RSA algorithm using PRNG techniques in MATLAB

RSA is the asymmetric cryptography system. The security of the RSA public-key cryptosystem is based on the assumption that factoring of a large modulus is difficult. In RSA if someone can factor modulus into a product of two prime numbers, then the private key is also detected and hence the security of the cryptosystem is broken. So it is quite important to research the selection of prime and derive the private key from the public key.
